# HDRP Sample Projects

To explore more complex usages of the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP), you have access to several fully interactive Unity Projects.

These projects are hosted on Unity Technology's GitHub. 

When you clone the Project's repository, make sure to use git or a git client. This is because if you use the Green button on the GitHub website, it does not download all the Assets.
