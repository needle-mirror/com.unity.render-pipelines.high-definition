# Lighting Debug Panel

The Lighting Debug Panel contains many tools for visualization various component of the lighting in the scene, shadows,  direct and indirect lighting, etc.

| **Debug Item**                          | **Description**                                              |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Enable Light By Type**                | Allows the user to enable or disable lights in the scene based on their type. |
| **Shadow Debug Mode**                   | Various overlays showing shadows.                            |
| **- Visualize Punctual Light Atlas**    | Shows an overlay of the whole punctual lights shadow atlas.  |
| **- Visualize Directional Light Atlas** | Shows an overlay of the whole directional lights shadow atlas. |
| **- Visualize AreaLight Atlas**         | Shows an overlay of the whole area lights shadow atlas.      |
| **- Visualize Shadow Map**              | Shows an overlay of a single shadow map.                     |
| **- - Use Selection**                   | Shows the shadow map of the selected light in the editor.    |
| **- - Shadow Map Index**                | Shows the shadow map of the visible shadow casting light at the given index. |
| **- Single Shadow**                     | Replace lighting in the scene with only the selected light rendered as black and white. |
| **- - Use Selection**                   | Shows the shadow map of the selected light in the editor.    |
| **- - Shadow Map Index**                | Shows the shadow map of the visible shadow casting light at the given index. |
| **Global Shadow Scale Factor**          | Change the global scale applied to shadow rendering resolution. |
| **Clear Shadow Atlas**                  | Allows user to force a full clear of the shadow atlases each frame. |
| **Shadow Range Min/Max Values**         | Allows users to rescale the range of value displayed in the various shadow map debug overlays. |
| **Lighting/Fullscreen Debug Mode**      | Shows various components of the lighting in the scene (Diffuse, Specular, Cascades, Luminance, ...) |
| **Override Smoothness**                 | When using any of the previous lighting debug modes, allows user to override smoothness for the whole scene. |
| **Override Albedo**                     | When using any of the previous lighting debug modes, allows user to override albedo for the whole scene. |
| **Override Normal**                     | When using any of the previous lighting debug modes, allows user to override normals for the whole scene. |
| **Override Specular Color**             | When using any of the previous lighting debug modes, allows user to override specular color for the whole scene. |
| **Override Emissive Color**             | When using any of the previous lighting debug modes, allows user to override emissive color for the whole scene. |
| **Tile/Cluster Debug**                  | Visualization modes for HDRP internal lighting structures    |
| **- Tile**                              | Shows an overlay of each lighting tiles and the number of light in them. |
| **- Cluster**                           | Shows an overlay of each lighting cluster intersecting opaque geometry and the number of light in them. |
| **- Material Feature Variants**         | Shows the index of the lighting shader variant used for this tile. Variants descriptions can be found in the **lit.hlsl** file. |
| **Display Sky Reflection**              | Display an overlay of the cube map used generated by the current sky and used for lighting. |
| **- Sky Reflection Mipmap**             | Scrub through the various mip maps of the sky reflection cube map. |
| **Display Light Volumes**               | Shows an overlay of all light bounding volumes either as a gradient or a solid color. |
