# Material Debug Panel

The Material Debug Panel contains tools for visualizing various material and object properties.

| **Debug Item**               | **Description**                                              |

| **Common Material Property** | Displays the selected property for all objects on screen. Available properties are those shared by all HDRP materials. |
| **Material**                 | Displays the selected property for all objects on screen using a specific shader. Available properties depends on the shader type. |
| **Engine**                   | Displays the selected property for all objects on screen using a specific shader. Available properties are the same as in the **Material** mode but in the form they are used in the lighting engine (example: Smoothness becomes Perceptual Roughness). |
| **Attributes**               | Displays various attributes of 3D objects like Texture Coordinates or Vertex Color. |
| **Properties**               | Highlights objects using the selected property (lightmaps, instancing, ...). |
| **GBuffer**                  | Displays properties stored in the GBuffer for deferred material. |
| **Material Validator**       | Shows validation colors for PBR diffuse color, specular color and metallic properties. |
