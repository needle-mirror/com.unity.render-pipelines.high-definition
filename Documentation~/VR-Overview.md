# Virtual Reality in the High Definition Render Pipeline

To use Virtual Reality (VR) in the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP), you must enable VR in your Unity Project. To do this, see the [VR tab](Render-Pipeline-Wizard#VRTab) in the Render Pipeline Wizard.

Please refer to [Unity XR](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/XR.html) documentation for more information about XR developement with Unity.

## Recommended Settings

HDRP has been designed to fully support Single-Pass Instanced mode. This mode gives you the best performance on all platforms.
HDRP also supports multi-pass but this is slower on the CPU and some features, like Auto-Exposure, can cause issues.
If you encounter a problem with a specific feature, you can disable it in your Projectâ€™s [HDRP Asset](HDRP-Asset).

## Supported Platforms and Devices

* **PC with DX11**:
  * Oculus (Rift, Rift S)
  * Windows Mixed Reality
* **PS4**:
  * PSVR

Note that built-in support for Open VR is deprecated as of Unity 2019.3, but you will still be able to use it in Unity 2019.4 LTS. For more information, see [Unity XR platform updates](https://blogs.unity3d.com/2020/01/24/unity-xr-platform-updates/) on the Unity blog, and [XR Plugin Architecture](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/XRPluginArchitecture.html) in the Unity Manual.
The XR Plugin architecture links to the OpenVR desktop package and has further info and recommendations.

## Resolution Control
There are multiple methods that you can use to control the resolution of your render targets in HDRP, but be aware that HDRP does not support every method available in standard Unity using the built-in render pipeline. [XRSettings.renderViewportScale](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/XR.XRSettings-renderViewportScale.html) has no effect in HDRP and generates a warning if you use it. Use one of the following methods instead:
* **Dynamic Resolution**: You can use the [dynamic resolution system](Dynamic-Resolution.md) to change the resolution at runtime. This is the best method to use if you want to change the resolution at runtime.
* **Eye Texture**: You can set the device back-buffer resolution by changing [XRSettings.eyeTextureResolutionScale](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/XR.XRSettings-eyeTextureResolutionScale.html). This is a resource intensive operation that reallocates all render targets.

## C# defines

You can use the following defines to include or exclude code from your scripts.

* ENABLE_VR: The C++ side of the engine sets this define to indicate if the platform supports VR.
* ENABLE_VR_MODULE: Unity sets this define if your Project includes the [built-in VR module com.unity.modules.vr](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-disable.html).
* ENABLE_XR_MODULE: Unity sets this define if your Project includes the [built-in XR module com.unity.modules.xr](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-disable.html).
