# Ray Tracing Environment

This component allows you to use ray tracing in your Scene. It defines which Layers use ray tracing effects, as well as a bias . If your Scene does not contain this component, then you can not use ray tracing.

## Using the Ray Tracing Environment

To add a Ray Tracing Environment to your Scene, you can:

- Add the component to a GameObject already in your Scene.

- 1. In the Scene view or Hierarchy, select a GameObject.
  2. Select Add Component > Scripts > Unity.Rendering.HighDefinition > HD Raytracing Environment.

- Create a new GameObject with the component already attached.

- 1. Select GameObject > Rendering > Ray Tracing Environment.

## Properties

The LayerMasks define which GameObjects to include in the  Note that every new layer combination triggers the build of a different ray tracing acceleration structure which will increase the execution time.
