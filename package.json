  "description": "The High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) is a high-fidelity Scriptable Render Pipeline built by Unity to target modern (Compute Shader compatible) platforms. HDRP utilizes Physically-Based Lighting techniques, linear lighting, HDR lighting, and a configurable hybrid Tile/Cluster deferred/Forward lighting architecture and gives you the tools you need to create games, technical demos, animations, and more to a high graphical standard.",
